For contribution read [below](#contributors).\n\nThis package has grown so much over the last year that I felt the need to make it more stable and community friendly. And this required a more deep refactor with lots of new ideas and improvements, also huge amount of :heart: and :sweat_drops:.\n\nSo here it is! **Enjoy and contribute!** :earth_africa:\n\n\u003e Please keep in mind that after **Atom `1.17.0`** some functionalities changed, and implementations of this package are still being tested for stability.\n\n## Installation\n\nIn a terminal / command line write the following line `apm install project-viewer`.\n\nOr just find the package by accessing the menu **Atom → Preferences... → Install** and search for ***project-viewer***.\n\n## Features\n\n- Group nesting;\n  - \u003e Infinite nesting of `groups` which can contain also `projects`;\n  - \u003e `projects` can be at any level.\n- Sidebar Left / Right (first or last) position;\n- Auto hide sidebar with hover behavior;\n- Resizable panel;\n  - \u003e *Double click* to default width;\n- Hide header for more space;\n  - \u003e This is available through a config option, default is *not autohide*.\n- Focus toggle;\n  - \u003e Toggling focus will switch between current active element and the panel.\n- `SelectListView` integration;\n  - \u003e Only shows `projects`.\n- Traverse and select `projects` with `up` and `down` keys;\n- Toggle collapse / expand of `groups` with `left` and `right` keys;\n- `status-bar` with the `project`'s' *breadcrumb* path;\n- Drag \u0026 Drop `groups` and `projects`;\n  - Drag and drop a `group` or `project` into a `group` will add it as a child;\n  - Drag and drop a `group` or `project` into an `project` will add it as sibling of the dropped item;\n  - Drag and drop a `group` or `project` into a clear space in the panel will add it as a root child;\n  - Order dragged `group` / `project` accordingly with dropped `group` sorting.\n- Open the local database file for direct editing;\n- Old database schemas conversion tools;\n- Backup services (**GitHub's *private* gist**);\n- Editor for `groups` / `projects` creation and update;\n  - Create, update and remove `group` or `project`;\n  - Automatic set it's name according to first path base name added;\n  - Batch operation on a `project` creation;\n    - \u003e Ability to create individual `projects` when more than one path is provided;\n    - \u003e Each project will automatically have it's name set to it's path base name.\n  - Filtering icons;\n  - List of icons in editor as *only icons* or *icon and description*;\n    - \u003e This is available through a config option, default is *icon and description*.\n  - Sort children `groups` / `projects`.\n    - \u003e Sorting root `groups` / `projects` is done through a config option.\n- Context menu for delete, update and create new `group` or `project`;\n  - \u003e Create option is only available in `groups` or the `root`.\n- Show the given path in a file manager.
